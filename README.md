# YWCC307-Group4
Group project for YWCC 307 (Group 4)

# Project Description
The intersection of social and finance—as well as shifting attitudes around what
we share about money online—have given way to an ambitious new wave of
financial products.

Your team is preparing an analysis for a client about a potential new product in
social finance area. Research the current state of art products on the market and
make a case for a new app (product) for an under-served market. Your analysis
should include strategy, innovation as well as disruption in the target market.
